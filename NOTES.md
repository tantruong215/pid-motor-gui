# Development Notes â€“ PID Motor Controller with GUI

**June 6, 2025**  
Repo initialized. Working on Arduino PID loop logic with quadrature encoder feedback. Drafting UI flow in Python for real-time plotting and parameter entry.

To Do Next:
- Get encoder interrupt working on Arduino
- Build basic Tkinter dashboard for Kp tuning
- Plan logging format for tuning sessions
